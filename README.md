## Setup
`node generateCardFacts.js`
This will download the card definition JSON files, card images, and generate the card facts TXT file.
*Note: This will take a while to run and can fail. But it will not re-download images it has already downloaded. Run it again until all the card images are downloaded. May take several tries.*
